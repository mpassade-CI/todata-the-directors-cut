# Todata - The Director's Cut


### README

![alt text]./todata.png

Here's what your README should include:
1. A screenshot of the app. (Feel free to update this if you change its look!
2. The app's features from a user perspective.
3. What tools and techniques you used.
4. Which of those tools were new to you.
5. Where the app is hosted.

For hosting the app, use one of the following methods:
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Has the advantage that every time you push to GH, it will (with some delay) update the hosted page using your changes.
* [Surge](https://surge.sh/). My personal favorite, as setup is easy and you can do it with one command from the command line.

Some good resources on what makes a good README in larger projects (including the ones you'll build later this term):

* An article about [what makes a good README for an open-source project](https://dev.to/scottydocs/how-to-write-a-kickass-readme-5af9#template). It also has a great README template.
* This one is just [another good README template](https://gist.github.com/fvcproductions/1bfc2d4aecb01a834b46).
* [README Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) - A short manifesto for writing the README as the very first thing.
